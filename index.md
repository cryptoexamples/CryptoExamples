# Introduction

## Goals

- Minimal complete and secure code examples for common crypto scenarios
- Using only standard library functionality where possible (minimal)
- Using only secure cryptographic functionality (secure)
- Providing copyable code that can be used right away (complete)
- Indicating if the code has been reviewed
- Automatic unit tests for all code samples
- State the cryptographic threats that are mitigated in each sample 
- State the cryptographic gurantees/features in each sample
