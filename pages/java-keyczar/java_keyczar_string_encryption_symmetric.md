## Use cases

- String encryption

## Preparations

### Dependency on keyczar library

Currently, keyczar is not available via Maven or similar dependency management systems. Therefore the easiest way to include the library is to add the libraries' jar-file to the classpath.

### Key generation

Keyczar stores encryption/deryption/signing-keys in a specific JSON-format. 
They have to be generated by the included `KeyczarTool` like the following:

- java org.keyczar.KeyczarTool create --location=./key --purpose=crypt --name="Key"
- java org.keyczar.KeyczarTool addkey --location=./key 

## Sample Code for Java based symmetric encryption using AES
